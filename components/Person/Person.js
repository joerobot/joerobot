        I'm a front end specialist with a focus on UI and data visualisation. Currently working with BBC News Visual Journalism team creating interactive web apps and immersive storytelling formats. My passions lie in leveraging modern JavaScript and CSS to create elegant and usable applications, though I also have a lot of experience working with complex Node JS tooling to facilitate efficient working methods and writing scripts to prepare large datasets for front end use.

        Experienced with working closely with non-technical stakeholders, mentoring junior developers and helping to onboard new starters, I pride myself on my communication skills. Working with others is part of software development that I genuinely enjoy. I advocate strongly for teams to be as diverse as possible, knowing the benefits of mixing gender, race and ability. Another topic close to my heart is mental health and wellbeing in the workplace, and I am a certified Mental Health First Aider.
