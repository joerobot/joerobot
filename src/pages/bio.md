Hello there 👋🏻

I'm a software engineer currently at [Fastly](https://fastly.com).

You’ll find me shipping UIs while embracing the messy human side of digital products and the teams building them. My curiosity for interesting people and socio-technical systems guides my career: helping to craft design systems and growth frameworks; thoughtful internal apps and developer tools.

I live in the beautiful town of Frome in Somerset, UK, where I spend a lot of time raising my kids, walking the dog and listening to as much new music as I can. Come visit some time.

Have a nice day,

Joe
